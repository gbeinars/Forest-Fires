# Forest-Fires

<p align="center"><project-description></p>

Included in this repository are data, milestones completed, and final presentation.

This project includes creating random forest model, KNN and gradient boosting, to predict the forest fire size class, and accuracy results are evaluated.

## Summary
The ability to predict what locations are more prone to fires, the most common causes of fires, or the size of a fire, can provide endless benefits.  By understanding more about forest fires, preventative measures can be taken and possibly save lives, homes, forests and wildlife.  Fires can be violently destructive and difficult to manage.  Fires are known to destroy millions of acres of forest every year and can spread and grow quickly.  Some causes of forest fires are controlled, accidental, intentional or natural.  Three types of forest fires are surface, ground and crown..  Surface only impacts a small area of the forest floor and are easiest to stop.  Ground fire, also referred to as underground fire, burns where there is dead and dry vegetation, spread slow, but difficult to put out because of its unpredictable pattern.  Crown fires are serious, destructive and deadly.[4]  This data will provide insight into forest fires with the purpose of developing a better understanding, and determine whether any factors of forest fires can be predicted, thus allowing for preventative measures to be taken.

## Problem Statement
Analyzing data collected on forest wildfires can serve a variety of purposes.  For example, if the cause of fires could be predicted, then preventative measures can be put in place.  This could save thousands of lives, the forests, and the wildlife.  Predictions of fire size can also allow for prior action to be taken.  
‚Ä¢	Are wildfires increasing over the years? 
‚Ä¢	Do certain geographic areas have more fires than others?
‚Ä¢	Are there any features that show correlation with fires?
‚Ä¢	Is it possible to predict the cause of a fire based on certain features?
‚Ä¢	What is the most common cause of forest fires?

## Built With

- Python

## Future Updates
Gaining more insight into the fire cause descriptions of miscellaneous and missing/undefined, could provide additional benefits and better the understanding of forest fires.  Additionally, there are a variety of factors that can influence forest fires that were not evaluated as part of this project, such as weather and geographic descriptions.
